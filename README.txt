Seawolf Router for Video (SRV)
==============================

The SRV library is a replacement for SVR written entirely
in python. The goal was to simplify the code used for
Seawolf's video streaming.

SRV contains a number of video sources (either live camera streams or streams of video files) which it can then broadcast to client applications. SRV was designed
with realtime robotic applications in mind.
